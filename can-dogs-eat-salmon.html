                                            <h2>Can Dogs Eat Salmon?</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Owners, including those who are new to dog ownership and those who have had dogs for many years, often ask themselves or others if a certain food is safe for their pets. One of the most common questions about what to feed dogs is whether or not they can eat salmon and other fish. While it's true that these animals naturally love fish (often refusing to eat anything else given the option) there are concerns over whether or not salmon is good for dogs to diet on regularly.
                                            </p
                                            <p>
                                                The short answer is yes. Salmon has many great nutritional benefits for dogs and their owners' alike: it contains Omega-3 fatty acids which help keep the heart healthy; acts as an anti-inflammatory agent; aids in the development of the brain and eyes; supports a healthy coat; helps with digestion, and more.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In this article, we'll take a look at the science behind salmon and dogs and find out what they need to know before feeding their pups any fish.
                                            </p>
                                            <h2>Is Salmon Good For Dogs?</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon is good for dogs. It has many different types of nutrients that can help keep your pet healthy.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon is high in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D. All of these nutrients are good for dogs to have. Protein is important because it helps keep your dog's muscles strong and his coat shiny. Salmon also provides a decent amount of vitamins that your dog needs to stay healthy as well.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This fish contains many long-chain omega-3 fatty acids which can be beneficial to both humans and dogs alike. These types of fatty acids promote heart health in people and luckily they do the same thing for dogs too! In addition, salmon has a high vitamin D content which may improve bone strength in small breeds like pugs or Boston terriers. Larger dogs will also be able to benefit from this nutrient because it helps keep the nails and teeth strong.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                To make matters even better, salmon is low in mercury and high in protein, making it a healthy choice for your dog's diet. It may be good to monitor how much you feed them though since too much of this fish may create flatulence or stomach discomfort.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As long as your dog does not have any allergies to fish then salmon will provide him with a large variety of vitamins and minerals that he needs for optimum health.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                As long as your pet is not allergic to salmon than you can add this fish to their diet. Salmon has many nutrients that are perfect for dogs and will keep them in good health if incorporated into their diet regularly.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Include salmon on a regular basis in your dog's diet to enjoy all of its nutritional benefits. The only drawback might be the time it takes to clean up after dinner!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Note: If you are giving your dog canned salmon, then make sure to buy wild-caught Alaska Sockeye salmon since it is considered safe from contaminants like mercury . Some other types of farmed or Pacific caught salmon may have certain types of chemicals in them that could be harmful to your dog.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In terms of toxicity, salmon is very low on the scale and should be fine for most dogs to eat provided they are not allergic to it. Salmon is a great source of protein and healthy fats which can benefit dogs who are underweight or looking to gain weight.
                                            </p>
                                            <h2>How Much Salmon Can Dogs Eat?</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                The amount of salmon to feed your dog will all depend on the size and breed of your dog. Large and giant breeds need more protein than small dogs.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The amount of salmon that one should feed their dog each day depends on the size and weight of the dog, but for a large or giant breed adult dog you could start out giving 1/4 to 1/2 pound once or twice per week mixed with other foods. For smaller dogs increase the amount by about half. Increase until your reach what is considered an optimal level of omega-3's while making sure not to overfeed, which can end up hurting your dog in the form of pancreatitis.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Be aware though that raw fish such as salmon may contain E. Coli , so if you are cooking it make sure you cook it well enough to kill any potential bacteria.
                                            </p>
                                            <h2>SALMON POISONING IN DOGS</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon has the potential to poison a dog if it is fed too much too often. Major symptoms of toxicity can include lethargy, weakness, difficulty breathing and muscle tremors.
                                            </p>
                                            <b>CAUTIONS</b>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon is generally a good source of protein for your dog but you should avoid feeding it to dogs with allergies like fish or shellfish. You also want to be careful about giving salmon to old dogs or small breeds as they may not tolerate the high levels of vitamin D very well.
                                            </p>
                                            <h2>CAN DOGS EAT SALMON RAW?</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            Eating salmon raw can cause serious problems for your dog because of the bacteria in raw food. This is especially true since dogs don't have a very developed sense of taste, so they'll likely eat anything you put down for them. Eating raw fish can also cause a vitamin B12 deficiency which could be fatal.
                                        </p>

                                                Smoked salmon is salmon that has been cured by smoking. Since salmon itself is high in sodium, smoked salmon usually contains a similar amount of salt as well.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                There's also the risk that the smoke used to cure it will contain carcinogens. So, for both nutritional and health reasons, your dog should avoid smoked salmon.
                                            </p>

                                                Please remember that moderation is key when it comes to giving your dogs any type of food item, including canned salmon. You don't want your pet to become overweight or sick from eating too much protein. Not only can tummy troubles occur when there's too much meat in their diet, but excess protein can lead to loss of calcium if your pup isn't getting enough calcium in his diet as well.

                                            <p>
                                                Salmon has actually been linked to causing diarrhea in dogs, thanks to its high protein content. Salmon also lacks some nutrients that most dog foods contain, like calcium and Vitamin B-12.

                                                This is especially true when it's served as a standalone meal or treat. Serving size is important! Always remember to feed your pup the recommended amount of food on his diet label, and watch out for what other foods you serve with your salmon.
                                            </p>

                                                Salmon caught in certain parts of the world have been known to contain toxins. These toxins can be dangerous to your dog, so you may want to avoid bringing salmon caught in those regions into your home.

                                            <h2>Salmon Poisoning In Dogs</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon poisoning in dogs is usually caused by eating raw fish. Although not all species of salmon are toxic to dogs, the risk is present with any type.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon poisoning in dogs is extremely dangerous because animals can develop a life-threatening illness (salmon poisoning) within 24 hours. In addition, there's no known antidote for this syndrome, so prevention is key. Salmon has to be prepared properly if you want your pup to eat it without harm.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Salmon poisoning in dogs is caused by thiaminase, and the signs are similar to those of propionic acidemia (PA) in humans. Thiamine or vitamin B1 is important for normal cellular function and specifically affects brain and nerve cells. Because salmon have a high level of thiaminase, which destroys thiamine, they can cause illness when eaten raw or undercooked.

                                                    Chicken sausage is usually healthier than pork sausage but, as always, check the nutrition information on any prepackaged product. Stats I tend to look for on the nutrition information of prepackaged sausages include: calories per gram, fat per gram (saturated and unsaturated), protein per gram, and anything else that stands out (e.g.: whether the sausage has an unusually high sodium content). If you want to get really serious about your sausage healthiness comparisons, you can make an Excel spreadsheet of your favourite brands, but I don’t recommend spending your weekend that way.

                                                    As with many foods, it’s all about ingredients and preparation.
                                                    
                                                    If you have the option of buying either from a butcher or meat counter such that it is not pre-packaged, the chicken sausage will usually be healthier.

                                                    If you've ever seen the movie "Jaws", you might think twice about including salmon on your dog's menu. After all, what could possibly be safe about an animal that looks like both a shark and a piranha? 
                                                    The truth is that this ocean predator is actually quite healthy for your dog to eat if it's prepared properly. 
                                                    First of all, when choosing salmon as food for dogs, you should only purchase farm-raised versions from reputable sources if thats the only option you have. The better option would be to only feed you dog wild caught salmon, but care needs to be taken when catching wild salmon. Wild salmon 
                                                    caught in certain parts of thev world are just as dangerous as farm-raised salmon.

                                                    <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                        and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
