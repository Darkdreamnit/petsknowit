                                                Your dog should not be eating bacon. Just like almost everything in life, there are good and bad effects of eating bacon. 
                                                Bacon has negative effects on dogs in the form of fat and sodium. You might find that your dog is very sensitive towards bacon
                                                 as some dogs tend to be very sensitive to any form of fatty food. The salty contents in bacon likewise makes it a bad treat.
                                                  A possibly deadly condition called bloat is of issue when salted food is consumed by larger dogs,
                                                  triggered when the dog drinks excessive water when the salt in the bacon (or other salted food products like cured meats, ham, hotdogs, and so on) gets too much for them. 
                                                <p><b>P.S</b> - Bacon grease is just as bad if not worse than bacon itself.</p>
                                                <h2>The health risks associated with dogs and bacon</h2>
                                                <p>
                                                    A fully grown dog might be able to handle some of the negative effects of eating bacon, but small pups are more prone to serious health issues. The fatty grease that is inside bacon has the potential of clogging your dog's or pup's arteries. Smaller dogs such as miniature pinschers, Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, Yorkshire terriers, and many other small breeds are more prone to pancreatitis. This however does not mean that larger dogs will not be affected by this illness. The feeding of large bacon portions is known to be one way of introducing pancreatitis into your dog's body. Pancreatitis has been known to bring on other illnesses such as lipemia (this is when there are high levels of fat in the blood), diabetes, and many others.

                                                <p>
                                                    The first obvious step to take in treating your dog's pancreatitis would be to get all the necessary information from your veterinarian. The vet has to do the test necessary to confirm that your pet does indeed have the disease. The main objective of treating pancreatitis is to flush the fat from the body. This is what the vet will do by administering IV fluids. These fluids are used to flush said fat from the body. Potassium might be administered if there seems to be a low potassium count in the dog's blood.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    After the procedure has been completed, the vet will advise that you refrain from feeding your dog any type of hard food for the dog's pancreas to rest.

Uncooked pork has parasites and worms that put dogs at risk of serious health problems, including vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or even worse consequences if left untreated.

                                                        Yes, diarrhea will happen in your pet if they do not get the right balance in their diet. It is always a plus to know how to combat certain types of illnesses in your pets before they arise. Diarrhea is not a disease, 
                                                        it is simply a condition that happens when the body tries to get rid of bad food or certain types of pathogens before they are absorbed by the body.

                                                        This type of diarrhea can be treated easily at home by just putting your dog on a 24-HR rice-water diet. Be sure to use only white rice as it contains the necessary active probiotic cultures. Brown rice will not suffice. After putting your dog n the 24-HR rice-water diet, it would be best to put him/her on a short fast as this will allow the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) to rest.

Probiotics are good bacteria that are good for your digestive system. But where do we find probiotics? Probiotics can be found in foods and snacks such as yogurt, dark chocolate, some types of cheese, leafy greens and dandelion greens, onions, and many others. <u>Yogurt and lettuce are the only ones on this list that is recommended for your pet.</u> So one good treat to feed after your dog or dogs eat bacon is yogurt. It is a tasty treat while also helping the digestive system.

                                                            treatments and can even cause death in some cases. Raw bones are unlikely to splinter compared to cooked bones, however the threat is still present.
Some owners will not stop providing their canines with bones, thinking the pros exceed the cons by a lot. Each year, thousands of dogs end up in the emergency room because splinters.

Chicken bones are specifically most likely to get swallowed entirely or just partly chewed then swallowed. This has the potential of leading to intestinal tract perforation. 
Try to never feed your dog cooked bones, you are putting your dog at risk if you do so.

Although extremely toxic to dogs, it doesn't have much effect on a human's taste buds. This means that when you're baking and licking your fingers it's easy to accidentally give your pet far more than is safe. To make matters worse, xylitol has also often hidden in other seemingly harmless products like peanut butter or toothpaste!

                                                            Raw eggs, like all raw foods, can carry bacteria that can make your pet sick. Eggs are perhaps more dangerous than most other types of meat since they may contain salmonella which is a serious illness that could potentially kill your dog if not treated correctly at an early stage. Raw eggs should also never be given to puppies younger than 16 weeks old as it can cause permanent damage to their developing bones and joints even when cooked.

                                                            your dog bacon would be a bad idea. There are many other alternatives to feeding your dog bacon and I know your dog will love them too.
