                                            <p>Cheese has a great deal of dietary advantages that can offer a healthy benefit to your pet. Cheese is made up of protein, calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin A, zinc, and phosphorus. These are advantageous vitamins that are vital for your canine's health.</p>

<p>Cheese likewise includes fatty and salty elements, which can give some advantages to your dog's health. However, Too much fat and salt can trigger health problems.</p>

<p>The kind of cheese that you would feed your dog is likewise crucial to understand. Any type of aged cheeses like Parmesan, cheddar, and Swiss have 
    extremely small amounts of lactose in them. Mozzarella cheese includes a great deal of fat, so if you ever decide
     to feed some to your dog, make certain it's only in doggy treats sizes. Cheese can likewise be an excellent way to hide tablets for your pet dogs who need medication.</p>

     <h2>Is cheese bad for dogs?</h2> 
     <p>
         While it is true that there are many benefits for dogs that eat cheese in small portions, there are also health risks that are associated with cheese. 
     </p>

     <p>Not all pets can deal with a yummy reward like cheese. A lot of dogs have a condition that some of us humans 
         also have known as being lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerant suggests they can not manage dairy items. While the majority 
         of cheese consists of less lactose than many other dairy items such as whole milk. Dogs can still have unfavorable reactions to cheese if they are extremely lactose intolerant.</p>

<b>This is why you need to speak with your veterinarian prior to offering your pet dog cheese.</b>

<h2>Can my dog eat any type of cheese?</h2>
<span class="image featured"><img src="images/dogcheese/blue_and_Roquefort_cheese.JPG" alt="blue and Roquefort cheese" /></span>
<p>
    Not all types of cheese are the same. Some types of cheese are more dangerous than some. Two types of cheese that are dangerous to dogs are blue cheese and Roquefort. These two types of cheese should never 
    be fed to your dog under any circumstances as they have very high fat content. These types of cheese also pose life threatening implications if they are consumed after turning ripe. If these types of cheese are allowed to 
    be eaten by a dog after ripening, you should see a vet immediately as these types of cheese produce something known as roquefortine which can be deadly to dogs.
</p>

<h2>These dogs should not eat cheese</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Obese canines</b><p> Cheese has a high fat content and should be kept away from dogs who are overweight. Better meal or treat options for an obese dog can consist of ham, tuna and chicken.</p>

<li><b>Dogs that are Lactose intolerant</b></li> 
<p>Dogs that have an allergic reaction or intolerance to dairy products should not consume cheese at all.</p>
<li><b>Dogs with upset stomaches</b></li>
<p> If your canine has a hard time when they consume anything that isn't  a part of their normal diet, it would be wise  to not let give any cheese as it might cause illness or diarrhea.</p>
<li><b>Dogs with kidney issues</b></li><p> Some cheeses are known to have a high salt content therefore they are not a good choice for dogs with any type of kidney illness.</p></ul>

<h2>Using cheese to train dogs</h2>
<p>
    You will find that most dogs find cheese alluring. That makes it a perfect choice as a reward when training your family pet. A reward is one where your actions inform your canine you are ever so happy they have actually done what you asked of them. Be sure to only use cheese sparingly. 
    If your dog is having a hard time with recall, but somehow  finds cheese delicious, treating the, to small pieces of cheese will help them to understand that listening and doing is a good thing.

      <blockquote class="curly-quotes" cite="https://www.mypetchicken.com/backyard-chickens/chicken-help/Is-there-a-way-to-tell-if-my-chicken-is-happy-or-H72.aspx#:~:text=Chickens%20that%20are%20scared%20will,the%20things%20they%20need%20to!">
       Chickens that are scared will try to hide or run away.

Some people think chickens don't get sad, but they do, especially if they don't have enough room 
to perform normal chicken behaviors like scratching and so forth,
because their instincts are frustrated. This renders them helpless to do the things they need to! When
they are sad, often let out very sad sounds that are unmistakable, the same way your dog might whimper if
he is unhappy because he is hungry or needs to go outside.

When I lost my favorite hen to a predator, her sister cried sad sounds for several days, and looked for her
in all her favorite spots. When she realized Lily was not coming back, she followed me around for days wanting 
lots of petting and attention. She was lonely! When my rooster was injured, I kept him inside to recover, and his
favorite ladies would all wait right outside the sliding glass door to be as near him as possible.
They missed him in their chicken-y way, and I had to carry them all into the coop every night after dark, 
because they wouldn't go in without him. Once he came back outside, they all went in every night on their own like clockwork, just as before.

If you watch your chickens closely, after a while you will be able to learn their body language and know 
when they are happy, sad, broody, ill, scared, mad or something different entirely.

                                                        <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                            and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
