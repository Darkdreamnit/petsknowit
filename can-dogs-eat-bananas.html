                                                While banana peels are not poisonous to a dog, they are difficult to digest and might trigger some sort of blockage in the
                                                 digestive system. You should not only worry about the peel as feeding your dog too much banana can also trigger an upset stomach.

                                                 reactions to grains. And if it includes any type of raisins, take care as raisins are fatally hazardous to dogs.

                                                Along with raisins, there are some other concerns when it comes to feeding your dog banana bread. Below is a list of risks associated with feeding your dog banana bread.
                                            </p>

                                                    <p>
                                                        Chocolate is sometimes an ingredient in banana bread and is known to be lethal to a dog. Avoid any banana bread that has chocolate or chocolate chips as an ingredient.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <li><strong>Nuts</strong></li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There are many different types of nuts that can cause harm to a dog. Try to avoid all nuts when it comes to your dogs. One popular nut that are used in banana bread is the Macadamia Nut. 
                                                        The Macadamia nut is toxic to dogs and can cause pancreatitis.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <li><strong>Xylitol</strong></li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Xylitol does not promote the release of the substance known as insulin from the pancreas in us humans. When others such as dogs consume
                                                         something consisting of xylitol, the xylitol is rapidly taken in into the blood stream,
                                                         resulting in a powerful release of insulin from the pancreas. This is bad for dogs as it decreases the level of blood sugar. If this goes untreated, it can become life-threatening. 
                                                    </p>
                                                </ul>
