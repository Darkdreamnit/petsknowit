                                           <p><b>Rabbits should be fed a diet of mainly hay.</b> They are not picky creatures. You can give them a very wide variety of foods and they will eat them all. 
                                               Below is a list of the best type of foods you can feed to your rabbit.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Rabbits have delicate gastrointestinal systems and are really effective at processing food. If you present brand-new foods too rapidly, or feed 
                                                unsuitable food options, the bunny's typical digestion flora a.k.a normal bacteria,
                                                 will be interrupted, toxin and gas-producing bacteria can get out of control, and the bunny might end up being really ill and may even die.
                                            </p>
<ol>
<li>Hay</li> 
<span class="image featured"><img src="images/rabbits/hay_for_rabbits.JPG" alt="hay for rabbits" /></span>

<p>This is the staple of all rabbit's diet. The bottom of a rabbits diet pyramid would include long-stemmed plants. This makes up roughly 90 percent of most rabbit's diet.. 
Rabbits are grazing animals and require to have a limitless supply of fresh hay to munch on daily.


</p>
<p>
    Alfalfa hay is not an excellent option for an adult bunny, considering that it is a legume and not a grass type, and as such is a bit too rich to be eaten on a day-to-day basis. 
    Alfalfa can be fed to rabbits as a treat. Bunnies under one year old can be fed alfalfa hay, 
    however as they grow older they must be changed to grass type hay, particularly if they are likewise being fed alfalfa pellets.
</p>
<li>Pellets</li>
<img class="lazy" src="images/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="images/rabbits/pellets_for_rabbits.JPG" alt="pellets for rabbits" />
<p>You should feed a rabbit little amounts of pellets. Rabbits under 5 pounds should only be fed one-eighth of a cup while rabbits bigger than 10 pounds should be fed no more than a quarter of a cup.
     This is because pellets are not a vital part of a rabbit's main diet. Rabbits are known to have really delicate digestion systems. So whenever you introduce new types of hay or pellets, or  brand-new fruits and veggies, you need to introduce it slowly in order for the digestive system to adjust. 
Dwarf types and bunnies under 5 pounds need to get simply one cup of fresh veggies per day.
</p>

<li>Veggies</li>
<img class="lazy" src="images/loadingimg.jpg" data-src="images/rabbits/vegeatbles_for_rabbits.JPG" alt="vegetables rabbits" />
<p>
    
Vegetables and herbs are amongst a rabbits preferred foods. You can feed certain types of vegetables that you find in your ordinary grocery store., with a couple of exceptions and constraints. 
(There is a list of foods that you should avoid listed below.).

</p>

<h2>How to feed baby rabbits (Bunnies)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Steam disinfect all syringes, containers, and also nipple areas based on guidelines on the decontaminating bag.</li>
<li>Sit or rest on the flooring to feed the baby rabbits (bunnies), use a towel as a pillow in your lap for the bunny being fed. 
    Bunnies will jump unexpectedly, this is why you need to be on the floor to ensure that they do not toss themselves off a table or chair. Falling from a height of only a few feet can be deadly.</li>
<li>Hold the bunny horizontally in one hand, and hold the syringe or bottle in the other hand. </li>
<li>Infants typically resist feeding initially, however, you should resist the temptation to force feed your bunnies. Be persistent and mild. Try to keep your bunny hydrated  and fed, even versus his will, for a couple of feedings. More often than not, the infant will certainly start to sip or lap at the drops you provide. This is a good sign that you are doing something right. 
Please note that this might not happen on the very first feeding. Sometimes you can get lucky nd the bunny will catch on quickly.</li>
<li>Do not squeeze to much formula into the bunny's mouth! Be cautious that you bunny can breathe between sips</li>

<li>If the bunny grabs on to the nipple area and begins suckling, you should allow him/her including any kind of pressure on your own. 
Do not at any time squeeze the container or put any type of pressure on the syringe. The bunny must have the ability to suckle with sufficient force to get enough formula out of the bottle or syringe.</li>
<li>If your bunny does not suckle, it is not a big deal. Most bunnies will certainly discover how to lap/sip from the tip of the nipple area. 
    This is great as it will reduce the chance of your bunny passing out from the blockage of their airway. Attempt to hold the nipple downpointed or sideways, 
    about the mouth, to better minimize the risk of aspiration.</li>
<li>If your bunny does happen aspirate formula, it can block the respiratory tract as well as cause the bunny to lose consciousness. 
    This should be avoided as much as possible. You should learn or practice how to do the "bunny heimlich".</li>
    <li>It would be great to describe the bunny heimlich in this post, but i think it would be best described by a veterinarian.</li>
</ol>

<h2>So what foods can kill a rabbit?</h2>

                                                        <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                            and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
