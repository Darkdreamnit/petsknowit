                                                Many individuals believe that family pet allergic reactions are brought on by a cat's or dog's fur, however the genuine source of family pet allergic reactions 
                                                is frequently a protein that remains in the urine and saliva of cats and dogs. You can find this type of clinging to a dog's dried flaky skin.
                                            </p>

                                                Some pet types are marketed as hypoallergenic since they do not shed fur as much as others or they shed extremely little. The dander that causes allergies isn't released in the air or
                                                 on the ground like other dogs due to the fact that they do not shed as much.  While you might have less dog hair with a with a dog that does not shed, no dog type is hypoallergenic.

                                                If you are allergic to being around dogs but still want to get one, follow these steps to reduce the risk of triggering your allergies.

                                               <li>Make sure your dog do not spend much time in  the room you spend most of your time</li> 
                                               <li>If you have great weather, let your dog play outside often with supervision.</li> 
                                               <li>Choose flooring that does not require carpets. Dander will get trapped in carpets.</li> 
                                               <li>Give your dog a bathe weekly to remove dander.</li> 
                                               <li>Use an air purifier.</li>

                                                                When dogs are mixed they will most likely have the attributes of both parents. Some will be able to mix a shedding dog with a non shedding dog breed to create a crossbreed that is half shedding and half non shedding dog.
