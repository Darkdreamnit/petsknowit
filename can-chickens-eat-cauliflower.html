                                              <div class="notepaper">
                                                        <figure class="quote">
                                                          <blockquote class="curly-quotes" cite="https://www.quora.com/What-do-I-feed-chickens">
                                                            My birds are free range (except at night of course). What I have done is dedicated some planting beds in their area to growing fodder for them. I plant a mix of barley, buckwheat, clover, rye, borage and amaranth seed. I placed some chicken wire over the planting box right after planting so the fodder grew right through it. That way, when they scratch around they don’t tear up all the plants.

                                                            I also purchase a 5 grain scratch at the feed store. During the winter, I buy dried meal worms or soldier fly larva. This gets them the protein they miss from fewer bugs in the winter.
                                                            
                                                            Another wonderful treat that they just love is scrambled eggs. If I have too many eggs, I will float the eggs for freshness(explanation at the end of the answer) to see which are getting too old to eat. The eggs that are still good but getting to the end of their shelf life, get scrambled and cooked with no seasonings. I then crush up the shells and add them to the mix. If I have some produce that is getting soggy I will chop that up and at it too. The hens go crazy for this.
                                                            
                                                            To float eggs for freshness: Fill a deep bowl or the sink with cool water. Place questionable eggs in the water. The eggs that float to the top are bad and should be thrown away. The eggs that are on their sides at the bottom are the freshest. The eggs that “stand on their heads” (meaning the blunt end of the egg floats up but the tapered end of the egg is still touching the bottom) or float at an angle, are getting to the end of their shelf life and should either be consumed within the next day (in baking or hard cooked) or or gifted to the hens.

                                                        <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                            and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
