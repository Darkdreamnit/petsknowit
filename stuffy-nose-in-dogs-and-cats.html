                                            <h3>How to treat rhinitis in cats?</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                To treat rhinitis in cats, firstly, a veterinarian has to figure out what the underlying cause of the illness is. This will ultimately tell the veterinarian the steps he/she needs to take to treat the rhinitis.

                                                    <p>If the rhinitis is accompanied by any form of bacteria, then the veterinarian will prescribe the correct antibiotic to combat the infection.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <li>Nasal Flush</li>
                                                    <p>
                                                        This form of treatment is used for cats with severe rhinitis. A nasal flush will remove any blockage from the nasal passageway.

                                                        An antifungal treatment will be administered if the underlying cause of the infection is found to be any type of fungus.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Some dogs and cats are very resistant to drinking water of any type of fluids. However, just like us humans, cats and dogs need fluids and nutritional support to have a strong immune

                                                        Some times rhinitis gets to the point where surgery will be necessary. The medical procedure to take care of rhinitis is called rhinotomy is necessary when rhinitis causes the growth of cancerous lumps.

                                            <h4>Do cat colds go away on their own?</h4>
                                            <p>
                                            Yes. Much like colds in humans, cat cold can go away too. Cat colds take anywhere between -2 weeks to clear up on its own. However, if there does not seem to be any health improvement by the start of the fourth day, 
                                            a veterinarian must be contacted.

                                            <h3>How do you help a cat that has a cold?</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                It is always good to offer warmed up cat food as this encourages the intake of needed nutrients into the body. Remove any discharge from their nose by wiping with a damp, clean cloth. Maybe the most important thing to do is to always make sure there is always enough drinking water available.

                                                No. It is very dangerous to put vicks on your cats as certain chemicals within vicks is poisonous. The toxic element in vicks is known as Camphor.

                                            <p>
                                                Treating your dog's stuffy nose at home can be helpful to your dog or be very bad at the same time depending on the severity of the stuffy nose. It would be wise to try and get a veterinarian 
                                                to take a look at your dog over a video call before you decide to treat stuffy noses in dogs at home.

                                            <p>
                                                If your vet gives you the go-ahead of treating your dog at home, then follow the steps bellow. 
                                            </p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Carefully massage your puppy's nose to loosen up the mucous and permit it to drain. Your dog will feel good when you do this just as how you would feel good when you rub the bridge of your nose.</li>

<li>Use a nasal aspirator. A nasal aspirator is used to draw out excess mucous. Be really mild while doing so, and make sure that you follow the
     directions of the aspirator while putting it into your animal's nasal passages. Make certain to clean up the 
    aspirator completely after usage, and, although I truly hope this need not be stated, do not utilize the exact same aspirator on your canine that you utilize for your kids.</li>

    <li>Have your pet lay on your bathroom floor before you start taking a hot shower. The steam will assist your dog in hydrating his nasal passages and possibly permit the mucous
         to drain. Do not leave the bathroom's exhaust fan on as this will only defeat the whole purpose</li>
         <li>A humidifier should be used to raise the moisture of the air inside your house. It'll likely produce much better outcomes if you restrict your dog to a smaller space with the humidifier close-by. Be specifically cautious to clean your 
             humidifier frequently in the way detailed by the maker-- unclean air humidifiers can trigger extra health issues.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                If your dog has stuffy nose and wheezing, it would be wise to see a veterinarian as soon as possible. This could mean that that your dog has more than one ailment happening at the same time. However, after contacting 
                                                a veterinarian, he/she might recommend getting over the counter nasal rinse for your dog which might help clear up his/her nasal passageway.

                                                        <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                            and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
