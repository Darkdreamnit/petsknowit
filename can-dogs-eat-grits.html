                                                 When it is prepared, it can look similar to grits which is why many people 
                                                mistake polenta for grits.

                                                    <p>Pets are at times our best friends. We should all take care of them with everything we have. They depend on us for food 
                                                        and shelter and they in turn give us their love and attention. We love our dog Sage and could never see ourselves living without her.</p>
